## Dificults

The main dificult was to adapt the code to run on Google Colab, because I have to run with Anaconda package manager with specific version of the some packages and python.

# Paper Context

The current models required a rendering step to apply Single-View 3D Reconstruction. This step is done along with visibility handling and evaluation of the shading model. The main objective of this paper was to demonstrate that it's possible avoid the rendering step and still get reconstruction results as other state-of-the-art models.
